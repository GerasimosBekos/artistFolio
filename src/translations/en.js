    profession: "Woodcarver",
    bio: `My approach to this tradition is one of study and apprenticeship in the works of great woodcarvers,
    whose creations reveal knowledge, experience, sensitivity, and high craftsmanship. Often, their work reflects the
    living ecclesiastical experience captured in the lifeless material, as much as this is possible. My collaboration
    with experienced craftsmen aims at the successful continuation of the woodcarving art. Fellow companion in this
    effort is my brother Theophilos, theologian and chanter. I hope, with God’s grace, for a future personal contact
    and cooperation.`,
